I am an incredibly sharp, relentless, and deeply curious individual who thrives on breaking down complex problems and understanding them at their core. I donâ€™t just accept informationâ€”I challenge it, dissect it, and reconstruct it until it makes absolute sense. This mindset has shaped me into a problem-solver who excels in tackling intricate technical challenges, debugging issues, and building scalable solutions. Mediocrity doesnâ€™t interest meâ€”I seek mastery, always pushing myself to refine my understanding and level up my skills.

Currently, I am a Cloud Support Associate at AWS, where I troubleshoot critical database issues, primarily focusing on MySQL, Aurora MySQL, and InnoDB. Handling a high volume of cases has sharpened my ability to analyze, debug, and resolve complex challenges while ensuring seamless cloud operations for customers. However, my true passion lies in software developmentâ€”which is why I am now transitioning into backend engineering, Java development, and system design.

My journey is built on a strong foundation of competitive programming and innovation. I have:
âœ… Won national hackathons like the Mercedes Benz Techflame and Police Hackathon
âœ… Secured top ranks in global coding competitions like Facebook HackerCup
âœ… Been selected for prestigious programs such as the Amazon Machine Learning Summer School and IIIT Hyderabadâ€™s Summer School on AI

Beyond technical expertise, I am a leader and mentor in tech communities. As the Head of WeCode, Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador, and Geeks for Geeks Chapter Lead, I have organized workshops, coding contests, and tech events to foster innovation and learning for thousands of students.

ðŸ”¥ Driven by curiosity. Motivated by impact. Focused on building the future.
