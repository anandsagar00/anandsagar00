I am a Cloud Support Associate at AWS, where I troubleshoot Relational Database issues, primarily focusing on MySQL, Aurora MySQL, and InnoDB. Handling a significant number of cases has deepened my expertise in these technologies, allowing me to analyze, debug, and resolve complex database challenges while interacting with customers to ensure their smooth cloud operations.

Beyond support, my passion lies in software development and building scalable solutions. My journey includes winning national hackathons like the Mercedes Benz Techflame and Police Hackathon, securing top ranks in global coding competitions like Facebook HackerCup, and being selected for prestigious programs such as the Amazon Machine Learning Summer School and IIIT Hyderabadâ€™s Summer School on AI.

I've also led and mentored tech communitiesâ€”serving as Head of WeCode, a Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador, and Geeks for Geeks Chapter Leadâ€”where I organized workshops and coding contests to foster innovation and learning.

Iâ€™m currently transitioning into software development, focusing on Java, backend engineering, and system design. If you're looking for a problem-solver with a proven track record and a drive to build impactful solutions, let's connect! ðŸš€
